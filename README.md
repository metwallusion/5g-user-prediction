# 5g-user-prediction
5g User Prediction: Dataset (1M x 60) Predicting if the user is connected on a 5g network or not. And can be found on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/metwallusion/5g-user-prediction

Putting machine learning techniques into work in the branch of wireless communication specially 5G is a challenging idea. Since we are looking for low latency and fast computations, we need to build a model that runs fast and performs well as it can be judged by its key metrics. In this report, our aim is to predict that the user is on 5G network or not. This 1000000x60 data is uploaded on Kaggle and can be downloaded from [https://www.kaggle.com/liukunxin/dataset?select=train.csv]. Luckily, me as a communication wireless engineer I was able to create a reliable area of interest during the analysis and to extract the best features during predictions.

These classifiers are used: (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Tools: Python
You will find my analysis and predictions on the ipynb (jupyter notebook file) 5g-user-prediction.ipynb
